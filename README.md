## Boxing Action Detection with CNN
w/[Talha Kaba](https://github.com/Kababey)

A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify boxing actions from video frames. The model is trained to recognize 8 different boxing moves including head/body strikes with left/right hands, blocks, and misses, achieving over 80% accuracy on the validation set. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this project processes scaled 180x180 RGB images and includes comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines for video frame extraction, annotation processing, and image scaling.
